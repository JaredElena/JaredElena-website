        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first-year student at the University of California and currently studying Business to pursue a career in Accounting. I graduated my Highschool with a high school diploma and a GPA higher than 3.5. During my time in High School, I found a need to create funding to help pay off my school so I applied for a position at In N Out. Successfully being able to secure an associate position I was able to learn new skills like how to work in a team, work in a fast-paced environment, and have a keen eye for quality. I worked in multiple positions such as a cleaner, cook, and cashier. With the amount of customers that come through the doors, the store was always busy but that didnâ€™t mean that quality was going to be one of the main points to look out for. That meant making sure that every meal was served to the standard that they would if the store was slower. That also meant that there were some problems that some customers did have but would be taken care of carefully quickly and precisely. I think with a supportive and hard-working team I was able to not only work my hardest every day but got to grow closer to those that I would spend hours at a time working with. I also learned how to get out of my comfort zone being constantly with new people that I've never seen and being able to interact with them every day I was able to gain some confidence and familiarity in getting to know new people.<br><br>

        Before my position at In n Out I found a great deal of work helping out my community such as helping my local church with their tech. I would go every other week with my aunt and as they were not only leaders but also singers they would find it a little hard to be working the sound audio while singing. This is where I found my opportunity to help with sessions such as weddings, vow renewals, Masses, and quinceaneras. I found working in this position that a lot of work goes into not only how levels of volume work but also how to mix vocals. <br><br>

        The first position that I worked was helping at my local high school when I was in middle school and they needed help with vending during football games. These tasks involve tending to customers handing out food or to take and orders. I had to work hard at times with getting food that was hot out because the weather at the time was really cold and waiting too long would then result in the food getting cold. Although I worked for only a couple of nights at a time I was able to learn skills about how to handle multiple tasks at once and some simple problem-solving that I think helped with me when I eventually got my position at In N Out. Above all else, I think putting time into helping the community was refreshing and prepared to be able to take on bigger tasks.
